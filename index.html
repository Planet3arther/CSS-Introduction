    <p>Throughout my journey, I've noticed some changes within myself. In my younger years, I had way curlier hair than    now, my voice was particularly high for a male, and I was super pale. I tend to get bullied back then since I was timid and my hobbies were kind of nerdy. Now that I've grown, I'm way taller, my voice became deeper, and I grew some body and pubescent hair. My hobbies became vast, I got into basetball, exercise, researching, and reading. I also realised that I tend to socialize more and dress more formally. But, in the end, I'm still that one kid that's still dreaming to make it big in life.</p>
